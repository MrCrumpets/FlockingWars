This is a project I started a couple years ago for fun which turned into a class project
and then an entry to a competition and then got abandoned with minimal tinkerage over the past year
and a half. I've done a not insignificant amount of work on it recently so I decided to post it here.

It depends on Boost::signals, and SFML 1.6. You'll need those to compile.
