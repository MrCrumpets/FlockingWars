This is a project I started a couple years ago for fun which turned into a class project
and then an entry to a competition and then got abandoned with minimal tinkerage over the past year
and a half. I've done a not insignificant amount of work on it recently so I decided to post it here.

How to build:

I don't have time to write up an elaborate build procedue but I will list the dependencies (AFAIK) so you
can try your luck.

boost::signals 1.52
SDL 1.2 (SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer)
GLEW

I'm tentatively thinking of dropping SDL in favour of SFML cause it hasn't really been a pleasure to work
with and SFML looks to be more C++ friendly.
